# Audio Transcription and Summarization Tool

## Overview
This Python tool is designed to transcribe audio files and provide comprehensive summaries of the content. It supports various audio formats and utilizes OpenAI's Whisper and Google Cloud Speech-to-Text APIs for transcription. Summarization is achieved through OpenAI's GPT-3 model.

## Features
- Audio file conversion to a compatible format for transcription.
- Audio segmentation for efficient and accurate transcription.
- Choice between Whisper and Google Cloud Speech-to-Text for transcription.
- Detailed and comprehensive summarization of transcribed text.
- Support for various audio file formats (`.m4a`, `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.ogg`, `.flac`).

## Requirements
- Python 3.11
- pydub
- requests
- google-cloud-speech
- openai
- dotenv
- tkinter (usually included in standard Python distribution)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Install required Python packages: 
    pip install pydub requests google-cloud-speech openai python-dotenv
3. Obtain API keys for OpenAI and Google Cloud and set them in your environment variables or `.env` file.
4. Ensure FFmpeg is installed and accessible in your system's PATH for audio file conversion.

## Usage
1. Run the script using Python:
   python Transcription_Local_OpenAI_Google.py
2. Select the audio file for transcription when prompted.
3. Choose the transcription service (Whisper or Google Cloud Speech-to-Text).
4. The script will process the audio, transcribe it, and generate a summary.
5. The transcription and summary will be saved to a text file in the same directory as the audio file.

## Configuration
- Modify the script parameters like `min_segment_len` or `silence_thresh` as needed for different audio environments.
- Update the OpenAI model or token limit in the `summarize_text` function for different summarization requirements.

## Logging
- The tool logs its process and errors in `app.log` for troubleshooting and review.
